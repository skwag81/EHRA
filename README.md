## Purpose

This program, called EHRA (External Hazard probabilistic Risk Assessment), is a MATLAB-based GUI developed to facilitate seismic probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for nuclear power plants (NPPs).

---

## Features

* EHRA consists of five integrated modules: 
   - External hazard information input  
   - Component fragility information input
   - Systems analysis model
   - Risk quantification
   - Output 
* Fully open MATLAB codebase  
* MIT-licensed and lightweight (runs on MATLAB Runtime if you have no MATLAB licence)

## Contributing

EHRA can be applied across academic, industrial, and educational settings. 
 - Researchers can utilize this tool to test newly developed algorithms in their work. 
 - Third-party reviewers involved in nuclear safety analysis can use EHRA as a complementary tool for independent verification of seismic PRA results. 
 - Its transparency and reliability can be effective during regulatory discussions, allowing analysts to provide detailed technical justifications for their computational methods. 
 - This can aid in validating outputs from commercial codes for existing reactors, with the results serving as benchmarks. 
 - EHRA can be used to teach seismic PRA concepts to students and industry professionals for educational purposes.
